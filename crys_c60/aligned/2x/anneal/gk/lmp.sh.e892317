WARNING: There is at least one OpenFabrics device found but there are
no active ports detected (or Open MPI was unable to use them).  This
is most certainly not what you wanted.  Check your cables, subnet
manager configuration, etc.  The openib BTL will be ignored for this

MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 0 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD 
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.

mpirun has exited due to process rank 0 with PID 89226 on
node n16 exiting without calling "finalize". This may
have caused other processes in the application to be
terminated by signals sent by mpirun (as reported here).
